Technologies Used
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning. In this project, NLTK is used for natural language processing tasks, including parsing user queries to understand and extract relevant information about tourist spots.

Fuzzy Logic
Fuzzy logic is an approach to computing based on "degrees of truth" rather than the usual "true or false" (1 or 0) Boolean logic on which the modern computer is based. In this chatbot, fuzzy logic is employed to interpret and process the uncertainties associated with human language inputs. This helps in enhancing the decision-making process within the chatbot, allowing it to suggest the most appropriate tourist attractions based on vague or incomplete user queries.

Tkinter
Tkinter is Python's de-facto standard GUI (Graphical User Interface) package. It is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk. In this project, Tkinter provides the graphical user interface that allows tourists to interact with the chatbot, making the application accessible to users who are not familiar with command-line interfaces.

Request-response Database
This component of the chatbot handles the storage and retrieval of data as needed. The request-response database stores user queries and the chatbotâ€™s responses. This setup enables the chatbot to learn from previous interactions and improve its predictions over time. It also ensures that the system can provide consistent and timely responses to user queries about tourist attractions.
